I'm Max Baylis, a masters student in Computing Science at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/). 

My main focus at the moment is building a real-time blockchain data analytics system at the [Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/cryptocurrency), Imperial College London. I'm using Spring, Kafka and Spark.

I previously studied law at Trinity College Dublin with a focus on legal technology and automated legal reasoning, and worked in publishing before starting at Imperial.

I enjoy taking online CS courses and have posted a few personal projects my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/baylism).
